CHAOS is a fun, chaotic web game built for boredom, laughs, and bad choices.
In this game, the worst possible decision is always the correct one.

- No scores.
- No goals.
- **Just chaos.**

## 🎮 What is CHAOS?

CHAOS is a choice-based game where you’re given everyday (and not-so-everyday) situations and three options:

1. One option is sensible
2. One is neutral
3. **One is the most chaotic (this is the correct answer)**

Choose the chaotic option to build your chaos streak and unlock fun surprises along the way.

## 🧠 How the Game Works

**Pick how much chaos you want:**
- Small Chaos
- Medium Chaos
- Full Chaos

**For each round:**
1. Read a situation
2. Choose one of three options

**See:**
- The chaotic choice (correct)
- The sensible choice
- Your choice
- What actually happened

The game reacts to your decisions with funny outcomes and short comments.

## 🔥 Chaos Streaks & Mini Games

Every time you pick the most chaotic option, your chaos streak increases.
**Picking a safe option resets the streak.**

### 🧩 Maze Game
- Can appear at multiples of 5 chaos streak (5, 10, 15, …)
- Appears with probability (not guaranteed)
- Optional and very quick
- Solving or skipping it resets the chaos streak

### 🧠 Word Guess Game
- Appears randomly
- Only when chaos streak is under multiples of 10
- Optional and lightweight
- Does not reset the chaos streak

*Both mini-games are designed as fun breaks and never block progress.*

## 🚪 Exit Anytime

CHAOS is meant to be light and forgiving. You can exit:
- From the main game
- From the maze
- From the word game

When you exit, you’ll see a friendly quote like:
> “Enough chaos for one day.”  
> “Go do something. Or don’t.”

**No guilt. No pressure.**

## ✨ Why CHAOS?

This project was built for a vibe-coding hackathon focused on:
- Weird ideas
- Useless (but fun) projects
- Creativity over perfection

CHAOS doesn’t help you make better life choices. It celebrates the bad ones.

## 🛠️ Built With

- Lovable (vibe coding)
- ChatGPT
- A questionable amount of chaos 🌀

## 🚀 Running the Project

The project is live-hosted. Just open the link and start playing — no setup required.

## 🌀 Final Note

CHAOS is not here to fix your life.
It’s here to remind you that sometimes, making the worst decision is the most fun.

**Play responsibly. Or don’t.**
